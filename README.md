# Signal-Processing-Project-A-Method-For-Fine-Resolution-Frequency-Estimation-From-Three-DFT-Samples-
The project is completely implemented in MATLAB




#OVERVIEW

The project suggests a nonlinear relation involving three DFT samples already calculated to produce a real valued, fine resolution frequency estimate. The estimator approaches Jacobsen’s estimator for large N and presents a bias correction which is especially important for small and medium values of N .

#GOALS

1. Our goal in this project is to estimate 𝛅 , where |𝛅|< 1/2 , from three samples around the peak in the DFT spectrum using different estimators.
2. Finally we comment on the accuracy of various estimators and find the most suitable one!
